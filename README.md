PlaylistProject
==============


A SPA displaying information about upcoming concerts in the user's metro area. A list of events is retrieved from the Songkick API, then matched to additional metadata using the Echo Nest platform. This will correspond to a streaming track in Rdio for the user to preview. I'm using the rdio-python library to access the Rdio API.

Currently slow to load due to the multiple API calls and needs to be refactored.
